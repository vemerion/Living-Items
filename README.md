# Living Items

This Minecraft mod is my entry to the "Item Transportation" ForgeJam!

The mod adds only one block, the "Sculk Item Awakener" (crafted with a Sculk Shrieker surrounded by Sculk), which can be placed adjacent to containers such as chests and barrels. These Awakeners can then be configured either as senders or receivers. Senders will extract items from the adjacent container and send them on their way to a linked receiver, and receivers will pick up these living items and insert them into their adjacent container.
